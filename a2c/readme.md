# Pytorch Advantage Actor Critic

### Description
This is a Pong specific implementation of A2C that focusses on conceptual understanding. The code style is heavily based off of [Karpathy's implementation of REINFORCE](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/a4166c7fe253700972fcbc77e4ea32c5). Hopefully it will help speed up someone else's attempt to understand the specifics of the algorithm!

See [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/7eljkx/understanding_a2c_and_a3c_multiple_actors/) for a discussion of the details of the algorithm.
