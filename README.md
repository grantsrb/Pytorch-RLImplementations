# Exploratory RL Implementations

## Description
This is a collection of RL algorithm implementations. Emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding of the core concept behind the algorithm (mainly for my personal learning). Each implementation uses Atari Pong from OpenAI's gym as the environment, and many of the implementations use this as an assumption in the implementation. Also, most of the code is, regretfully, not production worthy, but rather a demonstration of the core concept behind the algorithm of interest. Attempts at parallelization and GPU optimization are particularly bad...
